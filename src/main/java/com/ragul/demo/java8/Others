Replace PermGen with metspace
---------------------------
PermGen space has to be increases manualy using JVM arguments.
 But in Java 8, PermGen space has been replaced by Metaspace.
 Metaspace can auto increase memory size by itself thereby reducing the chances of OutOfMemoryError.

 HashMap Improvements
 ---------------------
 To improve performance with many collisions, Java 8 introduced the use of a red-black tree
 instead of a linked list for buckets with 8 or more elements.

 This tree structure allows for faster lookups (O(log n) instead of O(n) for a linked list) when searching for a specific key within a bucket.
 Threshold: The threshold for switching from a linked list to a red-black tree is 8.
 Benefits: This change improves the average time complexity of get() and put() operations in the presence of many collisions.
