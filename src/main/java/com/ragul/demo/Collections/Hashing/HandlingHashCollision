Hashcode is checked, if it exists (index) -> equals is checked

int keyName

HASHING:
Hash(keyname) -> returns hashcode
hashcode modulo size -> returns index (bucket index)

If two keys have the same index (same hashcode), it is called a collision.
now equals method is used to check if the keys are equal.
// If they are equal, the value is updated.
// If they are not equal, the new key-value pair is added to the linked list at that index.

 In most cases, HashMap provides O(1) constant-time complexity for insertion, retrieval, and deletion operations
