//A "LeetCode umbrella dynamic programming" problem would typically involve a scenario where you need
//        to find the minimum number of umbrellas needed to shelter a given number of people,
//        given different types of umbrellas with varying capacities, using a dynamic programming approach
//        to optimize the solution by breaking down the problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems.
