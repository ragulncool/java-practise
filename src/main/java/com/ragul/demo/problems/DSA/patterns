1.SlidingWindow
ask subset of elements that satisfies given condition
I/P:Array, String or Link list

2. Two pointer
iterate through sorted array or list to find pairs that satisfy a condition

Fast & Slow Pointer:
Used in linked list or array problems, this pattern is ideal for detecting cycles or finding a midpoint.

Prefix Sum
Description: Prefix Sums/Products are techniques that store cumulative sums or products up to each index, allowing for quick subarray range queries.

2. Subset - similar to BFS
when we need to find all possible subsets of a set or string
repeated may be allowed or not
eg: permutations, combinations

3. modified Binary Search
when we need to find an element in a sorted array or list
eg:search in rotated sorted array, find peak element

check array contains duplicate elements
when we need to find the first or last occurrence of an element in a sorted array

4. Top k elements - Heap / Priority Queue
when we need to efficiently retrieve the k largest or smallest elements from a collection

5. Binary Tree BFS
when we need to traverse a binary tree in a breadth-first manner
use recursion or queue to explore all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level

6. DFS - Depth First Search - deep into branches and explore all nodes in a branch before going to next (before backtracking)
when we need to traverse a graph or tree in a depth-first manner
 use recursion or stack to explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking

 7.Topological Sort (Graph): Useful in finding a linear ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

13. K-way Merge: Employ this pattern to merge K sorted lists or arrays efficiently.

other
Cyclic Sort: Employed when you need to sort numbers within a defined range, it provides a neat way to ensure ordered data.
