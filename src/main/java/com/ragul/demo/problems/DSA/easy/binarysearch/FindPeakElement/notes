a probelm can have any peaks

there always be a peak since -INF TO INF
//A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors 9left and right).
//IMP: greater but not equal to neighbours
//find a peak element and return its index. The array may contain multiple peaks â€” return any peak.

SOLUTION WORKS FOR MULTIPLE PEAKS ALSO SINCE IF WE TAKE EG MID>MID+1, WE IGNORE RIGHT PEAKS ASSUMING PEAK IS ON LEFT

1 2 3 4 5
Understanding: -INF 1 2 3 4 5 -INF

1 2 3 4 5
peak: 5 since 5>4 and 5>-INF

5 4 3 2 1
peak: 5 since 5>4 and 5>-INF
