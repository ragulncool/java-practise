O(n^2) -> O(n)
space O(1)

subtract moving out and add new element -  sliding window

dynamic
window expands if charactees are unique - CORRECT WINDOW AND EXPECTED - DO OPERATOONS LIKE CALCULATING MAX LENGTH
window shrinks if there are duplicates - WRONG WINDOW  (until duplicate is removed - start is shrinked

in fixed size, window size is given
in variable size, execute from single to max where condition is breaked like duplicate exists)

count of subArray with given sum
    //1. we can use the formula: exactly(k) = atMost(k) - atMost(k - 1).

Fixed WIndow
-------

Max Sum Subarray of size K
Examples:

Input: arr[] = [100, 200, 300, 400] , k = 2
Output: 700
