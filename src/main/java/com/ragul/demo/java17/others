Always-Strict Floating-Point Semantics
This JEP is mainly for scientific applications, and it makes floating-point operations consistently strict. The default floating-point operations are strict or strictfp, both of which guarantee the same results from the floating-point calculations on every platform.

like switch pattern matching also introduced for others
Pattern matching is a programming language feature that allows you to concisely and safely extract components from objects and test their shapes. In Java, it primarily deals with the instanceof operator and type casting.

Before Java 17:
public void processObject(Object obj) {
    if (obj instanceof String) {
        String str = (String) obj; // Explicit casting
        // Use str as a String
    }
}

In Java 17:
public void processObject(Object obj) {
    if (obj instanceof String str) {
        // Use str as a String directly
    }
}
