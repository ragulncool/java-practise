the Template Method pattern is used extensively in the implementation of various template classes.
 These template classes provide a skeletal implementation of an algorithm or process, and allow the user to override specific parts of the algorithm or process as needed.

The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation,
deferring some steps to subclasses. Spring's Jdbc Template, Rest Template,
and Jpa Template are examples.
