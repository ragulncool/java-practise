The Decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class

In Spring, the Decorator pattern is used in several places to provide additional functionality without changing the original behavior of the objects.
eg: Decorator pattern in Spring is the use of the HandlerInterceptor interface to provide additional behavior to HTTP request processing in a Spring MVC application.
