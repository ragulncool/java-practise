The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide
 which class to instantiate. It lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

 The Factory Pattern is a design pattern used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object
  that will be created. Instead of calling a constructor directly to create an object, you use a factory method or a factory class.


  . In Spring, the Factory Pattern is used to create instances of beans dynamically, based on the current state of the application. Spring provides two main implementations of the Factory pattern: BeanFactory and ApplicationContext.
