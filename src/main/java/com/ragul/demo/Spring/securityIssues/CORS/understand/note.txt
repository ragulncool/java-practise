Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)


BROWSER CORS:
-----------
frontend server: frontend.com calling backend server: backend.com
by default, The browser’s strict origin policy doesn’t prevent the client application from making requests to cross-origin sites.
 Instead, it blocks the client application from accessing the response sent by cross-origin applications if the appropriate headers are not present. Therefore, CORS is not a typical API endpoint security mechanism.

 what browser needed:
 Access-Control-Allow-Origin header should be present in response with * or frontend.com
