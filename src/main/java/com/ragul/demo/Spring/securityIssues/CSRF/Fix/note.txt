Customize the CSRF token
1. CSRF token is generated by the server and sent to the client in a cookie or as part of the response body.
2. The client must include the CSRF token in subsequent requests to the server, typically in a custom HTTP header or as a request parameter.
3. The server validates the CSRF token in each request to ensure that it matches the token generated for that session.
4. If the CSRF token is valid, the server processes the request; otherwise, it rejects it.

// CSRF token is a security measure to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks, where an attacker tricks a user into making unwanted requests to a different site.
// CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server and sent to the client.
// The client must include the CSRF token in subsequent requests to the server, typically in a custom HTTP header or as a request parameter.
// CSRF token is typically included in the request headers or as a hidden form field in HTML forms.
